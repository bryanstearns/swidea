http://www.surf22.com/startups/startups.htm  Provides business start-up information and the following check list for starting an on-line business:

1. Brainstorm. Come up with an idea for your site, will it be strictly content based or will you focus on selling products or services. Maybe even a combination of the two to make a truly effective site.

2. Domain Name: Secure yourself a web address. You need at least one and if you want your site to ever make money it can't be hosted on a free server.

3. Professional Web Site: Decide if you will design your website or have someone else do it for you.

4. Web Hosting: If your site isn't available 24/7 you are losing money, take the time to research your options.

5. Unique product: While you can sell products for other people if you don't have one that is  unique you will never be completely secure and independent.

6. Credit Cards: Don't expect to sell much if you don't accept credit cards on your site. There many options, choose the best one for your budget.

7. Effective Promotion: If you don't promote your site on a regular basis in an effective manner you'll never get enough traffic to make it worthwhile.

8. Customer Service: Follow up on all inquiries in a timely manner, as soon as someone sends you an e-mail chances are they have moved on to a competitors site, you don't have much time.

9. Newsletter: Find an opt-in strategy and encourage visitors to fill in their email addresses so you can stay in touch with them.

10. Affiliate program/Diversified revenue: At some point in your online business you will probably want to add an affiliate program to create an online sales force that promote your product or service in return for part of the profit. Also by promoting a couple of quality related affiliate programs you can earn additional income from your site as your traffic increases.
